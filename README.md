Material manipulation script for Stop Motion Helper
==========
Script which is meant to help out with the screenshot based rendering in stop motion helper, which allows playback of specific animated materials that were setup to work with the script through console. Also comes with a macro for Pulover's Macro Creator, as it doesn't work with Stop Motion Helper's own makescreenshot commands.

Static Prop Replacer
==========
LUA script that is meant to spawn in prop_dynamics in place of map's prop_static entities, it is meant to work together with "blackify" script. It also has a python script made by Awsum N00b which extracts static prop data from map decompiles and turns them into files that the script uses.
